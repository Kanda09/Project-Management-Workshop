# Project-Management-Workshop

We encourage you to participate in this workshop with a partner.

We'll be initiating a new GitHub repository for the My Paint project. Please discuss with your partner how to break down the project into manageable tasks.

For instance, hereâ€™s a suggested way to structure the tasks for the side menu:
- Side menu:
	- Color Picker
	- Tool selector
		- pencil tool
		- eraser tool
      - ...
	- Shape Selector
		- Square shape
		- Round shape
		- Star shape
      - ...
